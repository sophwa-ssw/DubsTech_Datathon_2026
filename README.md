## Datasets used:
- Provided 2025 AQI by County dataset
- AQI by County datasets from 1980 to 2024 pre-generated by the EPA
    - https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual
- EPA AQS API data
    - https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html#format

## [Predict the future Max AQI for a county](Predict_Future_Max_AQI.ipynb)
- Uses historical data aggregated from yearly summaries by the EPA and linear regression to predict a Max AQI value for a given County, State in a given Year
- Data cleaning and set up performed in [Test_Notebook.ipynb](Test_Notebook.ipynb)

## [Predict the counties with the highest Max AQI in 2027](Predicted_Highest_Max_AQI_Counties.ipynbipynb)
- Uses historical data aggregated from yearly summaries by the EPA and linear regression to predict Max AQI values for all counties in the dataset in 2027
- Data cleaning and set up performed in [Test_Notebook.ipynb](Test_Notebook.ipynb)

## [Clustering of counties based on historical air quality patterns](Historical_Air_Quality_Model.ipynb)
- Uses data called and aggregated from the EPA AQS API to cluster and predict high-risk counties with 79.82% accuracy
- Data cleaning and set up performed in [Data_Cleaning.ipynb](Data_Cleaning.ipynb)
